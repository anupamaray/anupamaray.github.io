    <h2>Research Scientist at IBM Research Labs, India</h2>
    <p>Successfully developed and deployed a Deep Parsing based Natural language Understanding module that extracts important attributes from unstructured text on Salesforce services platform leading to better query understanding and improved retrieval. (Best Deployed Paper Award AAAI 2020 and several awards in IBM)</p>
    <p>Lead and developed Automation solutions for different Technical support domains. These solutions (based on Machine learning and Robotic Process automation) aim to automate redundant work done by human agents saving time and costs. (OTAA and RDA awards at IBM)</p>
    <p>Worked on cognitive e-mail assignment problem, which involves construction and continuous learning of diagnostic classifiers to detect and handle concept drifts in email ticketing system for the IT-support domain. (Best Deployed Paper Award AAAI 2019)</p>
    <p>Working on Meta-learning using few-shot learning for depression prediction using Multimodal data (speech, text and video)</p>
    <p>Worked on interaction-based assessment of Emotional Intelligence cues from multimodal data. This work is piloted with an NGO working to improve caregiving to children rescued from trafficking where our intelligent models help in hiring of emotionally aware and intelligent counselors.</p>
        
    <h2>Research Associate at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi</h2>
    <p>Successfully developed an end-to-end script independent (printed) OCR system for 4 Indian languages using LSTM networks</p>
    <p>Tested across 5000 test pages of each script and achieved an accuracy of 90%+ (over each script) </p>
    <p>Software (submitted as a desktop version) has been tested on Linux. The entire OCR system is real time, allows batch processing of full books and has an interactive GUI which allows selection of several input preprocessing routines, editing and saving outputs.</p>
    <p>Implemented a post-processing module using suffix trees to list top 5 words for every incorrect word, which further increased the accuracy by 4%(average for 4 scripts)</p>
    <p>Implemented a text to braille converter to convert the OCRâ€™ed text to Braille fonts.</p>
